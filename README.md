## Pitch of the project

Many individuals want to sell or rent their property(ies) themselves, but end up calling on the services of an agency...

Why?

Well, as an individual, it is very difficult to deal with the flow of candidates that are interested, and the various mediums used to communicate with them (phone, sms, emails,...). In addition to that, deal with their files and plan their visits is a total mess...

I have a good news, now, <span style='color: #006bd6;font-weight: bold'>immolib</span> is there! üòç

With <span style='color: #006bd6;font-weight: bold'>immolib</span>, all of this is over.

In three simple steps, you can link your ad to leboncoin, pap, seloger,... to the app, and organize your visits, collect your candidates' files, get notified of the visits to come,...

And talking of your candidates, book an appointment to visit your property is as simple for them as it is for you to setup all of this! 

They just have to click on the link to <span style='color: #006bd6;font-weight: bold'>immolib</span> that you will paste to your ad, and they'll can choose their slot to visit your magnifiscent residence.

The Hacking project is an intensive tech bootcamp that works without teacher nor school. The strength of THP is its community. Indeed, THP relies on peer-learning to pass on skills and knowledges.<br/>
